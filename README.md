Challenge Question
Think about someone who might have a problem. That "someone" can be a person, organization, institution, or community. Then identify a problem, which that particular someone is facing - any level or kind of problem.

 

Now, we want you to think about a solution to this problem. Really think about it - no solution is too big or too small. Imagine you have an unlimited budget and supply of material.

 

Create your own solution to this problem, a solution that incorporates the use of digital technology. You can present it in any way you'd like: write an essay, write the code for an app, create a website, create a prototype or mockup, design sketches, or record a video.
